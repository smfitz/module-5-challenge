# Work Day Scheduler #

This project was a good way to familiarize myself with the 
different Third-party-API's we learned about in this course.

And although most of my code was based off of instructor demonstration
I still feel like it really advanced my understanding of these concepts.

The most difficult part of this project for me was actually work flow.
I soon will be integrating all onto my mac setup but I have been having 
most of my work done on my desktop and then use my dads mac to actually 
push my code to git. This is just because I actually only know how to do 
this on a mac but soon I will just be using one system for all my work flow.

The reason this made it dfficult is because I was trying to track different versions of 
my work and this is getting harder to do as time in the course goes on and projects 
require more and more code. I also was having a hard time setting up functionality for
the alert nothification at the top of this screen. I wanted to refrence this 
element using a querySelector and then setup an eventListener to make this only
appear when something was saved to the local stoarge and then disaper after. This was a 
element I would have learned if I spent more time coding in the quiz app that was our
last challenge but is a feature I could add in the future.
